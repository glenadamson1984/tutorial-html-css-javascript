In addition to the 2 inputs and the button you should also add a title called Log In - this is just plain text.

We discussed labels so make sure you have labels for email and password.

You will want a check box with the text Remember Me. (a checkbox is just another type of input).

You will also need a Forgot Password link which should navigate to './forgotpassword.html'

Feel free to look at the loginPage.png image although for this lesson don't worry about styling.
